# ðŸŒ… MCITlib: Multimodal Continual Instruction Tuning Library and Benchmark

## âœ¨: Introduction

Welcome to MCITlib â€” a comprehensive library for continual instruction tuning based on multimodal large language models. This repository continuously integrates a range of existing methods, including MoELoRA, HiDe-LLaVA, and CL-MoE. In addition, MCITlib provides evaluation results for these methods across diverse benchmarks and model architectures. Through MCITlib, we hope to foster broader interest and engagement in this promising research field.
